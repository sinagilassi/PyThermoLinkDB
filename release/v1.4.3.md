# 🆕 v1.4.3 Release Note: mkdt, mkeq, mkeqs Functions

## 🚀 New Features

### 🧩 mkdt, mkeq, mkeqs: Flexible Thermo Source Builders

- Added three powerful utility functions in `pyThermoLinkDB.thermo`:
  - `mkdt`: Quickly create a data source for a component.
  - `mkeq`: Instantly generate a single equation source for a component and equation.
  - `mkeqs`: Build all equation sources for a component at once.

---

## 📝 Usage Examples

### 1️⃣ Create Data Source for a Component

```python
CO2_dt = mkdt(
	component=CO2_comp,
	model_source=model_source,
	component_key='Name-State',
)
print(CO2_dt.props())
print(CO2_dt.prop(name='EnFo'))
```

- 📦 Instantly access all properties for your component.

---

### 2️⃣ Generate a Specific Equation Source

```python
CO2_Cp_IG_eq = mkeq(
	name='Cp_IG',
	component=CO2_comp,
	model_source=model_source,
	component_key='Name-State',
)
print(CO2_Cp_IG_eq.fn(T=298.15))
print(CO2_Cp_IG_eq.calc(T=298.15, P=12))
```

- 🧮 Calculate and evaluate specific equations with ease.

---

### 3️⃣ Build All Equation Sources for a Component

```python
CO2_eqs = mkeqs(
	component=CO2_comp,
	model_source=model_source,
	component_key='Name-State',
)
print(CO2_eqs.equations())
Cp_IG_eq = CO2_eqs.eq(name='Cp_IG')
print(Cp_IG_eq.calc(T=298.15, P=12))
```

- 🔗 Access and compute all available equations for your component.

---

## 💡 Why Use These?

- 🏗️ Simplifies building and accessing thermodynamic data and equations.
- ⚡ Fast, flexible, and easy to integrate into your workflows.
- 🧪 Perfect for rapid prototyping and testing with real data.
